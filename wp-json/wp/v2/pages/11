We live in a world where accessibility barriers are diverse and complex, and new ones are emerging at an exponential rate. How do we support inclusive decision-making? How can we ensure that media content and platforms are accessible to people with different abilities and preferences? How can we promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in media production, representation, and consumption? How can we develop accessibility standards that are responsive, inclusive, and effective? To answer these questions, we need to build an expansive community of practice that encompasses the full range of experiences of disability and other areas of expertise needed to realize accessibility goals. This conference is an opportunity to co-create resources and to share knowledge and lessons learned in advancing accessibility and inclusion. We invite you to join us in this collaborative effort, and to ensure that the global accessibility agenda is guided by people with disabilities. Together, we can make Canada and the world more accessible and inclusive for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fees<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online only (Zoom) $25 CAD<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Montreal, in-person $175 CAD<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please contact us if you need financial support to participate. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn More &amp; Register<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming Soon!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For participation support, sponsorship opportunities, to volunteer or for other inquiries please contact Lisa Liskovoi <a href=\"mailto:lliskovoi@ocadu.ca\">lliskovoi@ocadu.ca<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"news\"><em><strong>NEWS<\/strong><\/em><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-we-count-recount-december-2021\"><strong>We Count Recount: July-August 2023<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"261\" src=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1024x261.png\" alt=\"We Count Recount by Inclusive Design Research Centre\" class=\"wp-image-2594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1024x261.png 1024w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-300x77.png 300w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-768x196.png 768w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1536x392.png 1536w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-2048x522.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchi.mp\/c4e10d86e0cd\/the-we-count-recount-jul-aug-2023\">July-August 2023 issue<\/a> of the IDRC&#8217;s monthly newsletter! <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/hBMRev\">Subscribe now<\/a> to have the Recount sent directly to your inbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:75px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-we-count-recount-december-2021\"><strong>We Count Recount: May-June 2023<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"261\" src=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1024x261.png\" alt=\"We Count Recount by Inclusive Design Research Centre\" class=\"wp-image-2594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1024x261.png 1024w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-300x77.png 300w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-768x196.png 768w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-1536x392.png 1536w, https:\/\/deep.idrc.ocadu.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/New_Banner_Newsletter_revised-2048x522.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchi.mp\/437927c5c201\/the-we-count-recount-may-jun-2023\">May-June 2023 issue<\/a> of the IDRC&#8217;s monthly newsletter! <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/hBMRev\">Subscribe now<\/a> to have the Recount sent directly to your inbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:75px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"designing-proof-and-evidence-with-minorities-and-outlier-data\">Exploring Bias in Hiring Tools<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Exploring Bias in Hiring Tools\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Kaw0IuAV7dU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDRC at OCAD University, with the support of Kessler Foundation and Microsoft, has launched ODD (Optimizing Diversity with Disability). The goal of ODD is to investigate bias in hiring algorithms using non-disability-specific and synthesized disability-specific employment data. In the next year, we will work with the community to create synthetic models of resume and job seeker data that will be tested with online hiring systems. Our objective is to better understand how to mitigate algorithmic bias and to use this knowledge in future projects to develop algorithms that can optimize diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video presentation examines how AI technology is utilized in recruitment and selection, its implications for candidates with disabilities, and the question of accessibility and diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/idrc.ocadu.ca\/odd\/\">ODD<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:75px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"designing-proof-and-evidence-with-minorities-and-outlier-data\"><strong>Sentiment Analysis Workshop<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sentiment Analysis Workshop\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IMTgif81wc0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The recording of our Sentiment Analysis Workshop is now available on our YouTube channel!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We Count wants to help small organizations and their members get into the data ecosystem with a free, accessible workshop.
